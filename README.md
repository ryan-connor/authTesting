## Authentication Testing
Simple small project from an Odin Project Tutorial to practice user authentication.

## Description
Simple small project from an Odin Project Tutorial to practice authentication in express using passport.js and bcrypt.js. A basic frontend made with EJS lets users sign in/sign up to the app. A MongoDb saves the user info.

## Why?
The main purpose of this project was to practice authentication in express using passport.js and bcrypt.js. To be clear this is based off of an Odin Project tutorial, and is not intended to be a full app/project. It was used to get comfortable with using a view template engine to display a login to the user, hash passwords with bcrypt.js, and then authenticate them using passport.js local strategy.
